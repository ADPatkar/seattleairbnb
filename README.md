**Questions to answer:**
How are the listings clustered? Do popular attractions have a higher density of listings around them? How might the proximity to attractions relate to prices or times booked?
What times of year feature large movements in the price? Are these movements similar for all areas?
Do neighborhoods described as suburban cost less than those described as urban?
